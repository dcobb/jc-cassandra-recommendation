I just checked-in this project to github so I can work on it from anywhere. 

I am trying to build a simple checkin application with Cassandra as the data store. This is just to get a proper understanding of Cassandra. 

You are free to look into the code, although it really is not in any readable state whatsoever. 

The two main repos that you might want to look into are - 

http://github.com/rantav/hector
http://github.com/zcourts/cassandra-hector-wrapper
